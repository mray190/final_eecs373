Task I: Arm Control

	A. Inverse Kinematics
	Write a routine that moves the arm to a target state, (x, y, z, wrist tilt), for the 
	end of the gripper, while main-taining the elbow up conﬁguration. The wrist tilt is 
	should be 0 when the gripper is pointing straight down. To reach far corners of the 
	board, a small positive tilt (gripper pointing away from the arm base) might be 
	needed.
	
	B. Pick up balls
	Write a routine to pick up a ball. You will need to decide the sequence of motions to
	perform, e.g. open gripper, move above ball, move down, close gripper, move up.
	
	C. Place balls
	Write a route that places a ball at a speciﬁc (x, y) position. You will again need to
	decide the sequence of motions to perform. When placing a ball, you need to ensure 
	that your motion does not cause you to move already placed balls.
