D determine order of moving the servos
D tuning to not hit balls
-D should we go a little bit left of ball?
D order of operations, handling turns, etc

-D vector of twenty statuses where is abs(diff(s0 - s9)) >= 0.05 we prob are there
--D bool resend if we arent close enough?? while (resend) lcm.publish
-D Have an issue where status.radians is exactly PI (or really really close)
--D PI - 0 is always gonna be too big of a diff
