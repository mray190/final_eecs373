GIT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS AND CHEAT SHEET

SETUP

    If you're reading this, then you have successfully checked out your repository. You'll need to setup an additional
    remote to allow pulling any fixes that might be pushed to the upstream repository.
    
    Setup the upstream connection:
        git remote add upstream linus.eecs.umich.edu:/repositories/eecs467_w16.git

        Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork:
            git remote -v 

        Should show: 
            origin    linus.eecs.umich.edu:/repositories/aN_groupX.git (fetch)
            origin    linus.eecs.umich.edu:/repositories/aN_groupX.git (push)
            upstream  linus.eecs.umich.edu:/repositories/eecs467_w16.git (fetch)
            upstream  linus.eecs.umich.edu:/repositories/eecs467_w16.git (push)

SYNCHING WITH CLASS REPO
    To synch your repo with the class repo, you can use 
        git pull upstream master
    or if you have a clean working tree
        git pull --rebase upstream master
